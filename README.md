# Pagination With Reactjs

Pagination is the process of dividing a large data set into smaller, manageable segments or pages. It's commonly applied to lists, tables, or search results that could otherwise overwhelm users if presented all at once. Each page with specific numbers makes it easy for users to navigate effectively.

In this project, we'll create a pagination component for your ReactJS app. This will enhance your React skills by improving user experience, reducing loading times, and providing efficient navigation in your web-app or website. We'll explore best practices and offer solutions to potential errors you might encounter during the development process.

**Note:** Familiarity with JavaScript and ReactJS is assumed for this project. Please note that while we will use 'yarn' for package management, you can substitute 'npm' wherever applicable. We will be working with a fake API so that you can also learn how to implement pagination in real time.
